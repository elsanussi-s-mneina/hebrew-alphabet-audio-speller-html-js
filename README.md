# hebrew-alphabet-audio-speller-html-js

For spelling Hebrew using Hebrew letters in a real human voice, one letter at a time.

You push a button with the letter on it. The computer makes the sound of the name of the letter.

There is no need to install anything. Your web browser must not be too old.

Thanks go to the Hebrew teacher who provided the audio back in 2008.

If you have any questions, you can contact me.
